          GST Registration Online - An Overview Launched on 1 July 2017, the
          Goods & Services Tax (GST) applies to all Indian service providers
          (including freelancers), traders and manufacturers. A variety of
          Central taxes like Service Tax, Excise Duty, CST and state taxes like
          Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, Octroi, VAT are accumulated in the GST.
          Also, taxpayers with a turnover of less than ₹1.5 crore can choose a
          composition scheme to get rid of tedious GST formalities and pay GST
          at a fixed rate of turnover. Every product goes through multiple
          stages along the supply chain, including purchasing raw materials,
          manufacturing, selling to the wholesaler, selling to the retailer and
          then the final sale to the consumer. Interestingly, GST will be levied
          on all of these 3 stages. Let’s say if a product is produced in West
          Bengal but is being consumed in Uttar Pradesh, the entire revenue will
          go to Uttar Pradesh. What Are the Components of GST? GST has three tax
